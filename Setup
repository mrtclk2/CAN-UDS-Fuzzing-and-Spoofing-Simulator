# CAN-UDS Fuzzing & Spoofing ‚Äì Setup Guide

## üîß Virtual CAN Setup (vcan0)

To simulate a CAN Bus environment without any physical ECU or vehicle, we will use a virtual CAN interface called `vcan0`. This allows safe and controlled fuzz testing.

```bash
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set up vcan0
üõ† Install Python Dependencies
We use the python-can library to send CAN messages from Python.

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
pip install python-can
Make sure Python 3.x is installed and you're working inside a virtual environment if needed.

‚ñ∂ Run the Fuzzer
Launch the fuzzing script:

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
python3 fuzzer.py
You‚Äôll start to see outputs like:

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
[+] Sent: ID=0x7E0 Data=[0x10, 0x01, 0xFF, 0x3A, 0x22, 0x00, 0x00, 0xEF]
This indicates that spoofed and randomized UDS messages are being injected onto the virtual CAN bus.

üì° Monitor with Wireshark (Optional but Powerful)
If you want to inspect the traffic visually, Wireshark is a great tool.

Install and launch it:

bash
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
sudo apt install wireshark
sudo wireshark &
Choose the interface vcan0 and apply this filter to view messages from spoofed tester (e.g., 0x7E0):

text
Kopyala
D√ºzenle
can.id == 0x7E0
