# CAN UDS Fuzzing and Spoofing Simulator ðŸš—ðŸ’£

This project simulates malicious activity and diagnostic testing on a virtual CAN Bus, focusing on UDS protocol.  
It includes fuzzing attack vectors, spoofed messages, and protocol behavior analysis.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Perform UDS-based fuzzing against a virtual ECU
- Inject spoofed CAN IDs with valid/invalid payloads
- Monitor, log, and analyze responses
- Demonstrate reverse engineering and security testing skills

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- [x] ISO-TP framed UDS message generation
- [x] Brute force on Service ID and Sub-functions
- [x] Spoof messages from different CAN IDs
- [x] Response logging and timestamping
- [x] Easy configuration of payloads

---

## ðŸ§ª UDS Fuzzing Sample

```python
for sid in range(0x00, 0xFF):
    payload = [sid] + [random.randint(0x00, 0xFF) for _ in range(7)]
    send_can_message(spoof_id, payload)
